SUMMARY:
These are a couple python scripts that do the various tasks below:

even_minus_odd.py:
this script asks for a range of numbers, a multiple, and a first digit.  It then sorts the numbers into two lists, one for evens and one for odds, subtracts the odds from the evens and returns the value.
